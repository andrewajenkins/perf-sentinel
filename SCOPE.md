# perf-sentinel: Large-Scale Performance Monitoring Scope

## Current State Analysis

### Limitations Identified
1. **Scale Challenges**: Current design struggles with 260 tests running ~1000 steps across 25 suites
2. **Context Loss**: No visibility into which test/suite a slow step belongs to
3. **Job Aggregation**: No mechanism to collect results from multiple parallel CI jobs
4. **PR Workflow**: Missing PR-level analysis across multiple commits/pushes
5. **Data Management**: No lifecycle management for large volumes of performance data

## Proposed Architecture: Enterprise-Scale Performance Monitoring

### Phase 1: Enhanced Data Model & Context

#### 1.1 Rich Step Context
**Current**:
```json
{
  "stepText": "I log in as a standard user",
  "duration": 1200,
  "timestamp": "2023-12-01T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Proposed**:
```json
{
  "stepText": "I log in as a standard user",
  "duration": 1200,
  "timestamp": "2023-12-01T10:00:00.000Z",
  "context": {
    "testFile": "auth/login.feature",
    "testName": "User can log in with valid credentials",
    "suite": "authentication",
    "tags": ["@smoke", "@auth", "@critical"],
    "jobId": "job-123",
    "workerId": "worker-5"
  }
}
```

#### 1.2 Hierarchical Performance Analysis
- **Suite-level analysis**: Identify which test suites are degrading
- **Test-level analysis**: Pinpoint specific test files with issues
- **Step-level analysis**: Current granular step analysis
- **Cross-cutting analysis**: Performance by tags (e.g., @critical, @smoke)

### Phase 2: Distributed Data Collection

#### 2.1 Storage Adapter Pattern
**Architecture**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Storage Adapter Pattern                  │
├─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────────────┤

                    │  (Aggregates All)   │
                    └─────────────────────┘
```

#### 2.3 Result Coordination
```yaml
# CI Pipeline Configuration
stages:
  - test-parallel:
      jobs:
        - suite-a-d
        - suite-e-h
        - suite-i-l
        - suite-m-z
  - performance-analysis:
      dependencies: [suite-a-d, suite-e-h, suite-i-l, suite-m-z]
      script: |
        # Wait for all jobs to complete
        perf-sentinel aggregate \
          --pr-number $PR_NUMBER \
          --commit-sha $COMMIT_SHA \
          --wait-for-jobs suite-a-d,suite-e-h,suite-i-l,suite-m-z
        
        # Analyze aggregated results
        perf-sentinel analyze \
          --pr-number $PR_NUMBER \
          --commit-sha $COMMIT_SHA \
          --context full-suite
```

### Phase 3: PR-Level Performance Intelligence

#### 3.1 Multi-Commit Analysis
**Challenge**: Developer pushes branch 20 times before looking at report
**Solution**: Cumulative PR analysis

```
PR Branch Lifecycle:
Commit 1: [Performance Data] ─┐
Commit 2: [Performance Data] ─┤
Commit 3: [Performance Data] ─┼─► Cumulative Analysis
...                           ─┤   (All commits in PR)
Commit N: [Performance Data] ─┘
```

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// PR-level aggregation
const prAnalysis = {
  prNumber: 123,
  baseBranch: 'main',
  commits: [
    { sha: 'abc123', timestamp: '...', performanceData: [...] },
    { sha: 'def456', timestamp: '...', performanceData: [...] },
    // ... all commits in PR
  ],
  aggregatedBaseline: {}, // Performance baseline from main branch
  cumulativeAnalysis: {}, // Analysis across all PR commits
  regressionTrends: [],   // Steps that consistently degrade
  improvements: []        // Steps that consistently improve
};
```

#### 3.2 Smart Regression Detection
- **Immediate regressions**: Current commit vs baseline
- **Trend regressions**: Degradation across multiple commits in PR
- **Cumulative impact**: Overall PR impact on performance
- **Confidence scoring**: Higher confidence for consistent patterns

## Reporting Strategy

### Two-Pronged Approach

#### Immediate Feedback: Self-Contained HTML Reports
**Purpose**: Quick, actionable feedback for developers and PR reviewers
**Implementation**: Generate pytest-style HTML reports that can be viewed immediately

```html
<!-- Example HTML Report Structure -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Performance Analysis Report</title>
    <style>/* Embedded CSS for self-contained report */</style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="summary">
        <h1>Performance Report - PR #123</h1>
        <div class="metrics">
            <div class="metric regression">5 Regressions</div>
            <div class="metric new">2 New Steps</div>
            <div class="metric ok">147 OK</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="details">
        <table class="regressions">
            <tr><th>Step</th><th>Current</th><th>Baseline</th><th>Slowdown</th><th>Suite</th></tr>
            <!-- Regression details with suite context -->
        </table>
    </div>
    
    <div class="charts">
        <!-- Embedded JavaScript charts using Chart.js or similar -->
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

**Benefits**:
- **No external dependencies**: Report works offline, in CI artifacts
- **Rich visualizations**: Charts, tables, and interactive elements
- **PR integration**: Easy to attach to GitHub/GitLab as artifacts
- **Developer-friendly**: Familiar format, works in any browser
- **Immediate feedback**: Available as soon as analysis completes

#### Long-Term Vision: Database + Grafana Integration
**Purpose**: Advanced analytics, trend monitoring, and team dashboards
**Implementation**: Push structured data to time-series database for visualization

```javascript
// Example data structure for Grafana
const performanceMetrics = {
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  project: "my-app",
  suite: "authentication",
  step: "I log in as a standard user",
  duration: 1200,
  baseline: 1000,
  regression: true,
  prNumber: 123,
  commitSha: "abc123",
  tags: ["@critical", "@auth"]
};
```

### Development Guidelines for Cursor & Claude-4

#### Working with Each Phase
1. **Complete one phase before moving to next** - Each phase should be fully functional
2. **Maintain backward compatibility** - Existing functionality should continue working
3. **Test incrementally** - Run tests after each major component
4. **Update documentation** - Keep README and examples current

#### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests First** - Write tests for new components as you build them
- **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions within each phase
- **E2E Tests** - Test complete workflows at phase completion
- **Performance Tests** - Validate performance targets are met

#### Code Quality Guidelines
- **Consistent Patterns** - Follow existing code patterns in the codebase
- **Error Handling** - Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Logging** - Add appropriate logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Configuration** - Make new features configurable through YAML

#### Phase Completion Criteria
Each phase is complete when:
- [ ] All checkboxes in the phase are completed
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Backward compatibility is maintained
- [ ] Performance targets are met
